# tuilet

A TUI for [toilet](https://github.com/cacalabs/toilet), the premier
command-line ANSI text generator.

Tuilet makes it easy to experiment with fonts and command line
options, showing output in real time and displaying the Toilet
command for easy copy-pasting.

## Requirements

- A Unix-like OS (macOS counts)
- Either `toilet` must be in `$PATH`, or the `TOILET` environment
  variable must point to a valid Toilet or Figlet executable

## TODO

- Better font selector
- Support for colored output (e.g., `--gay` and `--metal`)
- Multiple font directories
- ???

## Bugs

Oh yeah definitely
